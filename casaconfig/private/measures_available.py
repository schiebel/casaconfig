def measures_available(measures_site=None, logger=None):
    """
    Return a list of available measures versions at measures_site.

    This returns a list of the measures versions available at measures_site.
    If measures_site is None, then the meausres_site config value is used.

    The list of available measures is sorted using the date and time fields of
    the file name so that the most recent file appears at the end of the list.

    The measures_site may be a single string value or a list of strings where
    each element is a URL where measures tar files are found.

    If measures_site is a list then the elements are used in order until
    an appropriate list of available measures is found (see more below). 
    If measures_site is not provide then the measures_site config value 
    is used.

    The first element of the returned list is always the measures site URL
    used to populate the list.

    The measures_site_interval config value may be used when determining which
    site to use if measures_site is a list. When stepping through all the
    elements of measures_site, if the most recent measures tar file at that 
    site has a date that is less than or equal to measures_site_interval 
    days before the current date then that list of measures tar files from 
    that site is returned. If none of the sites satisfy that criteria for 
    the most recent file then the list having the most recent tar file is 
    returned. 

    If the returned list is older than measures_site_interval days before
    the current date then a warning is logged and printed as determind
    by the casaconfig_verbose config value.

    When comparing the date of the most recent tar file with that of
    the current date, the date value (excluding the time) found in the
    tar file name is compared with the current date without any correction 
    for time zone differences. This is an approximate age of the most recent 
    tar file and is primiarly intended to identify a site that may not be 
    updating regularly (daily) as expected so that casaconfig can use another
    in the list of measures_site automatically.

    The list of available measures versions is the list of files at 
    measures_site that follow the pattern of *Measures*YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS*tar*, 
    excluding files that end in ".md5", where YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS are each 
    single digits (0 through 9).

    Note that the version parameter in measures_update must be an element in
    a list returned by measures_available so that measures_update can find
    the expected version. Note that measures tar file names will usually
    not be the same at different sites.

    Parameters
       - measures_site(str or list of str = None) - Each value is a URL where measures tar files are found. If measures_site is a list then the elements are used in order until a list can be assembled. Default None uses config.measures_site.
       - logger (casatools.logsink=None) - Instance of the casalogger to use for writing messages. Default None writes messages to the terminal. The value of config.casaconfig_verbose is used. The logger is only used if the last file in the returned list is more than config.measures_site_interval days before the current date.

    Returns
       list - version names returned as list of strings, the first element of this list is the is the site used. The file names are sorted by date and time as found in the name with the most recent name appearing at the end of the list.

    Raises
       - casaconfig.NoNetwork - Raised where there is no network seen, can not continue
       - casaconfig.RemoteError - Raised when there is an error fetching some remote content for some reason other than no network
       - ValueError - Raised when config.measures_site_interval can not be used as an int
       - Exception - Unexpected exception while getting list of available measures versions
